# Intro
The beast is a demo system used by [resin.io](www.resin.io) to show customers how resin works, updating multiple devices in real time spread across the world. The tower consists of 32 tiles arranged in a Decagonal prism design, each tile holds 6 Raspberry Pis' with screens for feedback. The tiles are self contained, holding the power supply and ethernet switch neccesssary to use the Raspberry Pis'.

The Bill of Materials below contains all the components and drawings necesary to create your own Beast. These are not the cheapest sources, we chose to procure as many items as possible from Amazon for ease and speed of delivery.

We are currently going through another iteration to 3.0 to reduce cost, assembly time and complexity.

All the Raspberry Pis' run our [Beast demo software](https://github.com/resin-io-projects/beast)

# Tile
The minimum quantity for manufacturing is 8 tiles.
